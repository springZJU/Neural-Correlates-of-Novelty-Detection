# Neural-Correlates-of-Novelty-Detection-in-the-Primary-Auditory-Cortex-of-Behaving-Monkeys
This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:
Yumei Gong et al., Neural Correlates of Novelty Detection in the Primary Auditory Cortex of Behaving Monkeys
To use the code, please follow these steps:

1. Install MATLAB 2021a or a newer version.
2. Add the "Matlab Code", "MATLABUtils" and "MultiChannelProcess" folders into the MATLAB path.
3. Run the script under each "Figure" folder (the *directPlot.m script can directly generate the figures presented in the article; *.mat contains the data used for plotting).
4. If you want to run the scripts using the original data, place the "Data" folder containing the raw data at the same level as this project.
