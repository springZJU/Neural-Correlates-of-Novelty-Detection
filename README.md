# Neural-Correlates-of-Novelty-Detection-in-the-Primary-Auditory-Cortex-of-Behaving-Monkeys
This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:
Yumei Gong et al., Neural Correlates of Novelty Detection in the Primary Auditory Cortex of Behaving Monkeys
To use the code, please follow these steps:

1. Install MATLAB 2021a or a newer version.
2. Add the "Matlab Code" folder to the MATLAB path.
3. Run the script under each "Figure" folder (the *_directPlot.m script can directly generate the figures presented in the article; Figure.mat contains the data used for plotting).
4. If you want to run the scripts using the original data, place the folder containing the "Matlab Code" one level above the folder that contains the "Data" folder with the raw data.
